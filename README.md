## About

<<<<<<< HEAD
This web front-end will be the main user interface to the KRApp. The KRApp intends to automate and ease the workflows associated with Key Responsibility Area documents used for performance evaluations in many organisations. This KRApp will be developed in several phases:

- A Minimum Viable Prototype (MVP) will be created with just the front-end and mostly dummy data.
- The KRApp back-end or business logic will be created.
- The front-end will be continually refactored to use the working back-end functionality.

This web front-end is created in Python with the [Flask framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/).
